# Client-Server
<b>How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?</b>

By writing code that follows guidelines, it creates modular and reusable code that is easy to maintain and very adaptable. The CRUD Python module could be used on retrieving and updating databases.

<b>How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?</b>

When I came across a roadblock in the project, I had to read and do research on how to get around it. If I am ever stuck, I will figure it out by reading or asking others who may have experienced similar issues to see how they solved it.

<b>What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?</b>
Computer scientists are developers who come up with solutions to common problems in the world. My work with Grazioso Salvare has helped create a more efficient way to search and filter through their database.
